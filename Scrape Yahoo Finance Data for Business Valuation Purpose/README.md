# Scrape Yahoo Finance Data for Business Valuation Purpose 

**A.	Problem:

A business valuation is a general process of determining the economic value of a whole business or company unit. When a company is looking to sell all or a portion of its operations or looking to merge with or acquire another company, business valuation is typically conducted. There are numerous valuation methods, such as discounted cash flow, capitalized excess earnings, and comparable publicly traded company. However, when performing comparable company analysis, analysts should make a great effort to compare the current value of a business to other similar businesses by looking at trading multiples like Price/Earning, Enterprise Value/EBITDA, or other ratios. Therefore, it is bothersome for analysts to look for different companiesâ€™ historical stock prices, valuation multiples, and financial statements to measure value. In this project, it allows users to access business valuation data faster.
