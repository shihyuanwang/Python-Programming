## NYC Bachelor / Bachelorette Weekend!

Good news! One of your friends is getting married, and they want you to help them plan their Bachelor/Bachelorette Party! Your friend has chosen New York as the city for the weekend get-a-way. You and your friends are looking for exciting, popular places to party, and quiet places to rest after the party. No problem! You'll just go on Yelp and find the best places right? But oh no! Yelp is under attack from hackers hired by angry small businesses who don't like their ratings on Yelp and AirBnB is being sued by the city of New York and can't operate right now. Your friends panic, 'How are we going to make sure we go to fun cool places and get a good night's sleep after?' Not to worry, you're a pythonista, and with the power of Python you can save the weekend. 

It turns out that New York City has lots of public information available to you in datasets. One cool public dataset is the number of noise complaints for loud parties at clubs, lounges and restaurants. Using this data, you can determine where the biggest parties are and where the fewest are! With your coding skills, you can solve this problem!

Attached are two files, parties.py and bar_locations.csv. The parties.py automatically takes the data from bars_location.csv and imports them into a list of dictionaries in parties.py for you to use. Fill in the functions in parties.py to complete the assignment. Your program should output something like below as an example:

`Noisy Metrics: {'city': 'BRONX', 'borough': 'BRONX', 'num_city_calls': 50000, 'num_borough_calls': 20000000}
Quiet Metrics: {'city': 'BROOKLYN', 'borough': 'BROOKLYN', 'num_city_calls': 200, 'num_borough_calls': 3000}`
