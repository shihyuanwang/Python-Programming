# Excercise - NYC Bachelor / Bachelorette Weekend

Good news! One of our friends is getting married, and we want to help them plan their Bachelor/Bachelorette Party! Our friend has chosen New York as the city for the weekend get-a-way. We are looking for exciting, popular places to party, and quiet places to rest after the party. No problem! We'll just go on Yelp and find the best places right? But oh no! Yelp is under attack from hackers hired by angry small businesses who don't like their ratings on Yelp and AirBnB is being sued by the city of New York and can't operate right now. How are we going to make sure we go to fun cool places and get a good night's sleep after? Not to worry, with the power of Python we can save the weekend. 

It turns out that New York City has lots of public information available to you in datasets. One cool public dataset is the number of noise complaints for loud parties at clubs, lounges and restaurants. Using this data, we can determine where the biggest parties are and where the fewest are!

Attached are two files, parties.py and bar_locations.csv. The parties.py automatically takes the data from bars_location.csv and imports them into a list of dictionaries in parties.py for you to use. The program should output something like below as an example:

`Noisy Metrics: {'city': 'BRONX', 'borough': 'BRONX', 'num_city_calls': 50000, 'num_borough_calls': 20000000}
Quiet Metrics: {'city': 'BROOKLYN', 'borough': 'BROOKLYN', 'num_city_calls': 200, 'num_borough_calls': 3000}`
