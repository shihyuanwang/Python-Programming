Write a python program that will download the latest 10 comic images from https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/

Navigate to the latest page by clicking 'Read More'. 

Requirements:

1. Use BeautifulSoup and the Requests library to download the image like we did in the example.

2. Extract the link to the previous image with BeautifulSoup/Requests

3. Write a for loop that will run 10 times, saving the latest comic images in the same location as your python code.

Make sure your program runs before you send it!
